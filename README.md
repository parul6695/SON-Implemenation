# SON-Implemenation
Implementation of SON (Savasere, Omiecinski and Navathe: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=673300) algorithm using the Apache Spark Framework. The program is developed to find frequent itemsets in two datasets, one simulated dataset (small1.csv, small2.csv) and one real-world dataset generated from Yelp dataset(user_business.csv). Apriori algorithm has been used to generate the frequent items.<br>
